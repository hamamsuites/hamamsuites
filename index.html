coast of Crete.In the old town, you can roam around the city and observe the Venetian and Othoman preserved elements,such as old manor entrances and wooden Turkish balconies (kiosks).As the old town isn't very big, in two hours you will have covered most of it's alleys.<br><br><br>Some of the main sightseeing are:<br><br>-The<u>Venetian harbor</u>, filled with fishing boats and lined with taverns.It's lighthouse is a more recent addition, built by the Egyptian conquerors.<br><br>-The<u>Venetian fortress</u>or Fortezza, the citadel of the city, is a well preserved fort built by the Venetians on the old Byzantine one.According to one theory, the hill on which the Fortezza is built was once, in a time lost in the mists of history, an island joined to Crete by a narrow strip of land. Over the centuries the channel silted up and the hill became part of the Cretan mainland. It houses the modern theater of the city, small churches and an Othoman mosque and warehouse.Fortezza offers panoramic views of the city, of the coast on the west and of the White mountains.<br><br>-The<u>Nerantze mosque</u>or Gazi Hussein Mosque, was a Venetian church dedicated to Santa Maria and later on, it became an Augustinian Monastery.However, when the Turks dominated the town in 1657, their leader, Gazi Hussein Pasha, turned it into a mosque with the highest minaret in town.<br><br>-The<u>Rimondi fountain</u>, built in 1626 during the Venetian rule.Named after the Venetian governor of the period, A. Rimondi, it continually threw water from three springs that had the form of lion heads and provided an important water source for the inhabitants of the Old Town.<br><br>-The<u>Loggia of Rethymno</u>used to be the meeting place of the noble people of the town to discuss economic and political issues. It also acted as a hosting place for many business and entertainment activities of the Venetians.<br><br>-The<u>Guora Gate</u>(Porta Guora or Grand Gate) is the main entrance of the old Venetian city walls that protected the city of Rethymno. The gate was built in the years of Rector Rettore Jocopo Guoro (1566-1568). It is 2,60 m. wide, built with carved stones with skew acnes, creating a semicircular arc on the top.<br><br><br><br><u>Must do:</u><br><br>-Visit the traditional phylo pastry workshop of Yiorgos Hatziparaskos in Vernardou str. 30<br><br>-Visit the open market area on Thursdays (4 Martyrs sq.) and Saturdays (near the bus station)<br><br>-Stroll along the beach of Rethymno on the 3 kilometers long pedestrian road<br><br><br><br><a href="./img/map.jpg" style="text-decoration:underline;color:#fff" target="_blank">Show map</a></p></div></div></div><a href="#about" class="bodyclose" onclick="toggleOff()"></a></div><div id="myModal2"><div class="modal-content"><a href="#about" onclick="toggleOff()"><span class="close">&#x2715;</span></a><div class="modal-body"><div class="row"><img src="img/about/beaches.jpg" alt=""><p>BEACHES<br><br>The province of Rethymno hosts some of the most special coasts of the island.The busier beaches can be found on the north coast, parts of which have been highly developed.You‚Äôll find wilder scenery, quieter beach villages and much less tourist development on the south coast of Rethymno.Naturally, by having your own car, your exploration chances will broaden significantly.<br><br><br>Some of them on the<u>north coast</u>are:<br><br><br>-<u>Episkopi beach</u>is bounded on the west by the river Mouselas and west by the river that runs in the gorge of Petres and the beaches of Petres.

It's a lovely beach with golden sand and crystal clear shallow waters, very well organized and close to all amenities of the city.<br><br>-<u>Bali</u>has four beaches, which are formed in sandy coves with nice greenish waters. The beaches are almost always calm, since the direction of Bali is western. They all are suitable for children and well organized. Moreover, water is cool because of the several springs that carry fresh water into the sea.<br><br>-<u>Spilies</u>or ‚ÄúTou Maliou to Riaki‚Äù (i.e. Maliou stream) is located 15km east of Rethymnon city, in a quiet area, just a few kilometers east of Skaleta and west of Geropotamos.
